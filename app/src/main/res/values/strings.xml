    <string name="batteryInfo">
        Earthquake detection on mobile devices is made possible by sensing changes in vibrations using the accelerometer.
        To use the accelerometer when the phone screen is off, Battery Optimization MUST BE DISABLED. SHAKESAFE WILL NOT WORK
        IF THIS IS NOT DISABLED. The entire functionality of the app resides in the ability to run in the background.
        If optimization is not disabled, the Android OS will suspend the app when the phone screen is off,
        which disables uploads and renders the app useless.
        Please disable this optimization for the app to work properly.
