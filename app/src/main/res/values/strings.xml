    <string name="info">
        The app checks if your device is shaking more than usual by comparing the accelerometer readings to the standard
        deviation. A signal is then uploaded to the cloud, where it is compared with data from other
        users and a decision can be made about an earthquake. If an earthquake is
        detected, a push notification will be sent out and the earthquake will appear on the map.

    <string name="uploadInfo">
        For ShakeSafe to work properly, please leave the app open in the background.
        The phone will only upload data when the screen is off, laying on a flat surface, and charging.
